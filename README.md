# new-kali-oscp-tools
Simple script to install AutoRecon and pip3 on a newly spun up OSCP Kali image. The Kali images provided by OffSec are notorious for breaking if you try installing anything on the box - so hopefully this script will allow users to install a few of the most important, most used tools in the labs.

It won't contain every tool, but this is a good baseline to get started.

INSTALLATION:  
git clone the repo  
chmod +x new-kali-oscp-tools.sh  
./new-kali-oscp-tools.sh
